# Gemini Project Analysis: NixOS and Home-Manager Configuration

This project is a comprehensive Nix-based configuration for managing multiple systems (NixOS and macOS) declaratively using Nix Flakes.

## Core Concepts

- **Declarative Configuration**: The entire state of each system is defined in `.nix` files within this repository. This allows for reproducible, version-controlled, and consistent system management.
- **Nix Flakes**: The project uses `flake.nix` as its entry point, which defines dependencies and outputs the final system configurations.
- **Home-Manager**: User-level configurations (dotfiles, packages, services) are managed via `home-manager`, allowing for a consistent user environment across different machines.

## Directory Structure

- `flake.nix`: The heart of the project. Defines inputs (like `nixpkgs`) and outputs (the system and home-manager configurations).
- `hosts/`: Contains per-machine configurations. Each subdirectory represents a host and contains:
    - `configuration.nix`: System-level settings for NixOS.
    - `home.nix`: User-level settings, which imports features from `home-manager/`.
- `home-manager/`: Defines the user environment.
    - `home.nix`: A base home-manager configuration.
    - `features/`: A modular collection of configurations for specific applications and tools (e.g., `git.nix`, `neovim.nix`). These are imported by individual `hosts`.
- `dotfiles/`: Stores the actual configuration files (e.g., `.gitconfig`, `alacritty.toml`). These are symlinked into the correct locations by home-manager.
- `lib/`: Contains reusable helper functions (e.g., `mkSystem`, `mkHome`) to simplify and standardize the creation of system and home configurations.
- `modules/`: Provides reusable sets of Nix options that can be shared across different host configurations to avoid duplication.
- `overlays/`: Used to add or modify packages in `nixpkgs`.

## How It Works

1.  The `flake.nix` file reads the configurations for each machine from the `hosts/` directory.
2.  Helper functions in `lib/` assemble the system-level (`configuration.nix`) and user-level (`home.nix`) configurations.
3.  The `home.nix` for each host pulls in desired application settings from the `home-manager/features/` directory.
4.  `home-manager` then takes the dotfiles from the `dotfiles/` directory and links them into the appropriate locations in the user's home directory.
5.  Running `nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#<hostname>` on a NixOS machine or `darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#<hostname>` on a macOS machine applies the configuration.
