# To disable programming ligatures, use `-calt` since this is the typical
# feature name for programming ligatures. To look into what font features
# your font has and what they do, use a font inspection tool such as
# [fontdrop.info](https://fontdrop.info).

# To generally disable most ligatures, use `-calt`, `-liga`, and `-dlig` (as
# separate repetitive entries in your config).

# Force one or a range of Unicode codepoints to map to a specific named font.
# This is useful if you want to support special symbols or if you want to use
# specific glyphs that render better for your specific font.
# 
# The syntax is `codepoint=fontname` where `codepoint` is either a single
# codepoint or a range. Codepoints must be specified as full Unicode
# hex values, such as `U+ABCD`. Codepoints ranges are specified as
# `U+ABCD-U+DEFG`. You can specify multiple ranges for the same font separated
# by commas, such as `U+ABCD-U+DEFG,U+1234-U+5678=fontname`. The font name is
# the same value as you would use for `font-family`.
# 
# This configuration can be repeated multiple times to specify multiple
# codepoint mappings.
# 
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals,
# i.e. new windows, tabs, etc.
